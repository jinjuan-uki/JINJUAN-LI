Research experience
	During the master's degree research topics based on bioinformatics mining, molecular docking technology combined with a variety of clinical gene chips (including 890,000 genes) to study the combined biological effects of estradiol, insulin growth factor 1, vitamin D3 and other substances in dairy products. Preliminarily ascertained the research status of the three nutrients in a variety of databases; in addition, using cell and mouse models, respectively, preliminary research on the metabolic pathways of the three nutrients in the cell body. Through the study of the master's level, the practical ability has been enhanced, the comprehensive scientific research literacy has been improved, and certain results have been achieved. Currently, one Chinese paper is published, one Chinese paper and one English paper are being written, and one software is being written.

Doctoral Training Program
	1. Use R language to analyze the research status of target compounds in multiple databases (GEO, TCGA), screen out the target compounds, and conduct database (KEGG, GO) enrichment analysis.
	2. Use molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulation and other methods to analyze the interaction between the target compound and the target, and screen out the key target.
	3. Verify the results of the virtual screening at the cell level.
	4. At the level of model organisms, comprehensively verify the biological effects of target compounds using metabonomic and genomic analysis methods.
